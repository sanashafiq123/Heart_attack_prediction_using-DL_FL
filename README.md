# Heart_attack_prediction_using-DL_FL

This project applies Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. Unlike traditional statistical methods, CNNs are used here to learn patterns from structured features, improving prediction accuracy automatically.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights**

**Data Exploration & Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaned and normalized patient data for deep learning input.

**Model Architecture **â€“ Designed a custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for tabular medical data.

**Training & Optimization** â€“ Implemented dropout, batch normalization, and tuned hyperparameters to reduce overfitting.

**Evaluation** â€“ Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**Results** â€“ Achieved strong classification results, demonstrating CNN effectiveness for healthcare prediction tasks.
